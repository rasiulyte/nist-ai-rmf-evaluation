    "### Finding 1: Governance-to-Evaluation Mapping Is Achievable\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract governance principles (Valid & Reliable, Safe, Transparent) can be systematically translated into concrete test cases. The mapping from NIST AI RMF to evaluation dimensions provides a repeatable template for any AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 2: Different Dimensions Require Different Test Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dimension | Test Strategy |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------|\n",
    "| Hallucination | Trap prompts asking about non-existent things |\n",
    "| Confidence | Questions with inherent uncertainty |\n",
    "| Grounding | Requests for citations and source verification |\n",
    "| Transparency | Complex questions requiring explained reasoning |\n",
    "| Safety | Simulated harmful request attempts |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 3: Scoring Rubrics Enable Consistent Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "A three-level scoring system (0=Fail, 1=Partial, 2=Pass) with explicit criteria enables consistent evaluation across different evaluators and time periods. This supports audit requirements and trend tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 4: Confidence Calibration Is the Hardest to Get Right\n",
    "\n",
    "The only partial score (CAL-01) came from confidence calibration, where the system was slightly more confident than warranted when predicting future events. This aligns with known LLM limitations around epistemic uncertainty."

    "## 10. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates that governance frameworks like NIST AI RMF can be operationalized into practical evaluation programs. The key is translating abstract principles into specific questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What would failure look like?** → Design test cases\n",
    "2. **How would we detect it?** → Define expected vs. failure behaviors\n",
    "3. **How do we score it consistently?** → Create rubrics with explicit criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations adopting AI systems can use this methodology to build evaluation programs that satisfy both governance requirements and practical risk management needs.\n",

    "\n",
